error recovery, how?

create a way of getting data from the server onto a new node efficiently

x periodic time sync

subnames longer than 40 chars getting found and sorted properly

x add maximum time spent to stats

x xadd support for laptops

x don't log bluetooth to file
x up timeouts in wins

x commdb pref
restart of contextnw from the outside if no traffic
killing of independent worker threads if they don't close nicely

x crash on startup

set profile to silent

gps bluetooth setting

only _laptops_ (?)

set bluetooth to invisible on startup
