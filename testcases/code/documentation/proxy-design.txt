extending battery life
----------------------

1st phase

a)
make keepalives specific
	client sends <keepalive/>
	proxy re-posts latest presence with new timestamp
		presence looks like: timestamp, escaped XML
		20051102T112907&lt;presencev2 ...

b)
suspend downstream when idle
	client sends <suspend/>
	proxy keeps a local copy of others' changed presence, but doesn't send downstream
	client keeps sending updates/keepalives of its

	client sends <resume/>
	proxy sends all changes

2nd phase
a)
	diffs-only downstream

		<presencev2>
			<x>...
			<y>...
		</presencev2>
	if client has received same <x> already, just send 
		<presencev2>
			<y>...
		</presencev2>

	if the whole presence is unchanged, just send timestamp
b)
	diffs-only upstream
