The presence info is sent via jabber, as an extended-away presence.
We simply serialize a CBBPresence object into XML, escape it
and put it into the text field. The server just routes the data,
it doesn't understand the contents.

Subscriptions must be done with a 'real' jabber client; there is
no support for that in ContextPhone.
